# Car Animation Assets

## Required Image
Place your car drifting GIF here with the name: `drifting-car.gif`

The GIF should:
- Show a car drifting with smoke effects
- Be approximately 250px wide for best results
- Have a transparent or white background
- Be optimized for web (under 500KB recommended)

If the GIF is not found, the application will automatically fall back to the SVG car animation.
